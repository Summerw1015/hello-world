Hello everyone, 

My name is Summer, and I am trying to learn to code.

That's about it. 

Oh and also, I am in college and I have a boyfriend now, so I am trying to make myself happy by spending time with him and making him do things that I love.<br>
I love my boyfriend so much but I can't find a valid reason. Maybe my heart just clicks when I see him and I know that's the right person. He is so nice and patient when he spends time with me alone. I wrote a love list for him at the end of 2020, sent it to him over messenger cuz we are distancing rn, and he said it was so cute, he doesn't deserve me. He said I really put so much into loving him and he is so moved by that. I just do whatever my heart is telling me to do and my logic would final proof that this is good to do. <br>
We are both very simple people. I think so much but sometimes I can't express my thoughts in words so they never come out of my mouth and nobody knows what I am thinking except myself. I sometimes tell these random thoughts to my boyfriend and that simply feels good.<br>
The very important conversation I had with my boyfriend, I am also glad we had that, is about what makes him happy. It all started with my dream that I had this fear that he would leave me for pretty and more ambitious girls. I had this insecurity hiding in the depth of my mind. The next day I decided to tell him because I think sharing thoughts like this is important although I was a little afraid about what his response would be. Do I make you happy in this relationship? <br>

This is what exactly I texted him.
The question was do I make u happy in this relationship and how 
and u paused for a long time
This is a random question btw but I just wanted to know <br>
u said u donâ€™t see how Iâ€™m making you happy at this moment, u said it the same way like u said u donâ€™t see why I canâ€™t see my top genre on Spotify 2020 wrapped <br>
And then I felt very bad and woke up <br>
Iâ€™m surprised I can remember it so clearly lol i might have missed some details tho<br>

This is his answer<br>
Bc you call me often<br>
In order to speak to me<br>
That alone makes me happy<br>
Of course I would prefer if we talked in person<br>
Right now I'm happy that someone I care about at least cares about me<br>
As well<br>
Idk man I don't want stuff like gifts or anything to make me happy<br>
I just want **attention** ðŸ˜‚<br>
Lol<br>
Thatâ€™s good to hear<br>
Are you happy?<br>
Iâ€™m very happy<br>
The same goes for me as well  I like attention, not from a lot of ppl tho thatâ€™ll be scary <br>
I feel good when ppl care about me and listen to me<br>
